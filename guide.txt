# 📘 Code Companion Plugin - Development Guide

## 🎯 What We Want to Create

We are building a **Framer plugin called "Code Companion"** that enables users to:
- Describe UI components in plain English
- Generate fully functional Framer-compatible React Code Components using Deepseek AI
- View and edit the generated code in a chat-like interface
- Preview the component live
- Copy the code into Framer projects with one click

The ultimate goal is to make coding in Framer accessible to non-coders and speed up ideation for developers and designers alike.

---

## ✅ What We Have Implemented

- ✅ Deepseek API integration for component generation
- ✅ Input field to describe a component
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- ❌ Cannot insert code components directly into the canvas (Framer SDK v3 does not support it yet)
- ❌ No state persistence (messages are lost on reload)
- ❌ Live preview sandbox is limited (iframes may not support complex component rendering)
- ❌ No error feedback from the AI if the response is invalid JSX
- ❌ No multi-turn refinement context beyond basic chaining

## 📚 Resources We're Using

- **Framer Plugin SDK v3**  
  [https://www.framer.com/developers/plugins-introduction](https://www.framer.com/developers/plugins-introduction)

- **Framer Code Component Reference**  
  [https://www.framer.com/developers/components-introduction](https://www.framer.com/developers/components-introduction)

- **Deepseek Coder API**  
  [https://deepseek.com](https://deepseek.com) (API documentation via developer dashboard)

- **UI Inspiration**  
  Real-world chat UIs like Smartsupp, Intercom, and WhatsApp for layout ideas

## 🔮 Future Plans

- 🔄 Refine code based on previous turns (true conversational context)
- 📦 Save generated components locally or in Framer's code panel
- 💾 LocalStorage or indexedDB to persist chat history
- 🧠 Add AI-powered “Refactor” or “Optimize” buttons for generated code
- 🌐 Allow importing external component libraries (Material UI, etc.)
- 🎨 Allow visual parameter customization (props sliders, toggle visibility, etc.)
- 🧪 Improve live preview environment to render more complex code safely
- 🧭 Add typing animation, message timestamps, and avatars for better UX
